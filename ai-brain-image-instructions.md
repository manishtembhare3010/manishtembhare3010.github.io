# AI Brain Image Instructions

To complete your portfolio's AI-themed profile section, you need to add an AI brain image. Here's how to do it:

## Option 1: Download a ready-made image

Download one of these high-quality AI brain images and save it to your `images` folder as `ai-brain.webp`:

2. [AI Neural Network Brain #2](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/futuristic-ai-technology-background-with-brain_13764692.htm)
3. [AI Neural Network Brain #3](https://www.pexels.com/photo/blue-and-white-brain-illustration-4597137/)
4. [AI Neural Network #4](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/10441431-artificial-intelligence-brain-logo-ai-technology-brain-vector-icon)

## Option 2: Use a placeholder URL (temporary)

If you prefer to set up quickly, you can use this direct URL temporarily in your HTML:

```html
<img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/futuristic-ai-technology-template-vector-disruptive-technology-blog-banner_53876-112228.jpg" alt="AI Neural Network" class="ai-brain-img">
```

Replace this with a downloaded image later for better reliability.

## Option 3: Make your own AI image

You can create your own AI-themed image using AI image generators:

1. Visit [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e/), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), or [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/)
2. Use prompts like:
   - "Futuristic digital AI brain with glowing neural connections, blue and purple, transparent background"
   - "Abstract neural network connections forming brain shape, minimal, high-tech, blue gradient"
3. Download the generated image and save it to your `images` folder as `ai-brain.webp`

## After adding the image

After adding the image to your `images` folder, push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add images/ai-brain.webp
git commit -m "Add AI brain image"
git push
```

Your AI-themed profile section will now display an attractive, animated brain visualization that represents your expertise in AI and LLM technologies!
